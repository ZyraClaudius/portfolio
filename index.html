            <h3 id="childhood">CHILDHOOD</h3>
            <section aria-labelledby="childhood">
                <p>I was born in Brighton. When I was three we then moved to the sunny Alpujarras in Andalucía, Spain. Seven years later we moved again to (not-so-sunny) Falmouth, Cornwall, where I went through secondary school and sixth form.</p>
                <h4 id="brighton">Brighton</h4>
                <p class="inset" aria-labelledby="brighton">I remember very little of Brighton, and most of it is pieced together from photographs and what I've been told. From what I can understand I was a large-eyed child who was most of the time naked save for occasional splatters of paint. I would write little stories in books which I stapled together, including a Mr. Men book which I felt was missing from the (quite enormous) published collection, but the name of the protagonist escapes me.</p>
                <div class="image-container" role="presentation"><div class="overlay" role="presentation"><p>Child Me</p><img src="" alt="me as a small child"></div></div>
                
                <h4 id="andalucia">Andalucía</h4>
                <p class="inset" aria-labelledby="andalucia">When I was young in Spain I loved reading, and I can also remember engaging in a (hopefully non-troubling) level of young-lad sadism, including drawing 'war comics' (pictures of little stick men in epic battles) and schematics for 'torture parks' (theme parks which brutally maim and brutalise members of the public). We kids used to have free reign of the village of Bayacas, where we first moved. We would have enormous mud-bomb fights in 'the padeira' (a scraggy patch of earth and grass) and bomb down the narrow and steep Andalucían alleyways on skateboards.</p>

                <h4 id="cornwall">Cornwall</h4>
                <p class="inset" aria-labelledby="cornwall">When we moved to Cornwall I became more indoorsy, although my love for computers had already started to show itself in the last few years we lived in Spain. In Falmouth I would often be found drinking tea in my room or on the sofa, reading or on my laptop. I also began to have money of my own through babysitting and the generosity of my elders, and found that I adored eating out. I also discovered a love of acting, through school plays. We went on fantastic holidays, to Sri Lanka, India, and Costa Rica.</p>

                <p class="inset" area-labelledby="home">I turned 18 not long before leaving for university. While in my second year, my family moved to Nanspean farm near Helston, Cornwall. It's a lovely place, with lots of outside space and outbuildings, and a view of the seaside.</p>

                <h4 id="bristol">Bristol</h4>
                <p class="inset" aria-labelledby="bristol">In September 2018 I moved to Bristol to study Mathematics with Study in Continental Europe at University of Bristol. I lived in Manor Hall in Clifton for my first year and made some wonderful friends and my now fiancee. We often went to Mr Wolf's to watch the fabulous JFS (Jazz Funk Soul Society) open mics.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="inset" aria-labelledby="bristol">Some of my friends and I then moved to Cromwell Road, St Andrew's, just off the Arches where Cheltenham Road becomes the infamous Gloucester Road. I dove headfirst into my love of music and the brilliant Bristol jazz scene, seeing Waldo's Gift and Snazzback play countless times at the Gallimaufry and other places around Bristol. I ate possibly hundreds of Grecian pizzas, as The Grecian (inimitable haven of reasonably-priced and delicious fare) was at the bottom of our road. It was while we lived on Cromwell Road that the COVID-19 pandemic started, and we spent the latter months of our tenancy mostly locked in our home, spending hours reading in the garden, countless barbecues and bottles of cider, some of the nicest times of my life so far.</p>

                <p class="inset"aria-labelledby="bristol">The pandemic meant that I couldn't go to study in Madrid, so instead I took a year out of study and went home to be with my family in late 2020-early 2021. I now live back in Clifton on Arlington Villas, and I'm in my final year.</p>
