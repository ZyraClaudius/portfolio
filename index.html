            <section aria-labelledby="childhood">
                <p>I was born in Brighton. When I was three we then moved to the sunny Alpujarras in Andalucía, Spain. Seven years later we moved again to (not-so-sunny) Falmouth, Cornwall, where I went through secondary school and sixth form.</p>
                <h4 id="brighton">Brighton</h4>
                <p aria-labelledby="brighton">I remember very little of Brighton, and most of it is pieced together from photographs and what I've been told. From what I can understand I was a large-eyed child who was most of the time naked save for occasional splatters of paint. I would write little stories in books which I stapled together, including a Mr. Men book which I felt was missing from the (quite enormous) published collection, but the name of the protagonist escapes me.</p>

                <h4></h4>
                <p>When I was young in Spain I loved reading, and I can also remember engaging in a (hopefully non-troubling) level of young-lad sadism, including drawing 'war comics' (pictures of little stick men in epic battles) and schematics for 'torture parks' (theme parks which brutally maim and brutalise members of the public). We kids used to have free reign of the village of Bayacas, where we first moved. We would have enormous mud-bomb fights in 'the padeira' (a scraggy patch of earth and grass) and bomb down the narrow and steep Andalucían alleyways on skateboards.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When we moved to Cornwall I became more indoorsy, although my love for computers had already started to show itself in the last few years we lived in Spain. In Falmouth I would often be found drinking tea in my room or on the sofa, reading or on my laptop. I also began to have money of my own through babysitting and the generosity of my elders, and found that I adored eating out. I also discovered a love of acting and writing</p>
